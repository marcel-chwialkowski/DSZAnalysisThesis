# DSZAnalysis
Probability Bounds Analysis of Neural Networks in Julia

## Dependencies
Builds on:
- the LazySets package for calculus with convex sets (https://juliareach.github.io/LazySets.jl/)
- the ProbabilityBoundsAnalysis package for p-boxes analysis relying on Dempster-Shafer interval structures (https://github.com/AnderGray/ProbabilityBoundsAnalysis.j) 
- the NeuralVerification package (https://sisl.github.io/NeuralVerification.jl/latest/functions/)
